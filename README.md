# Discord Forums Web

Status: unreleased / in-development

The intent of this project is make it so that the messages in a
Discord forum channel can be published to the web.

The motivation is finding that a lot of valuable knowledge are
being hidden behind the walls of a Discord server, such that they
can't be indexed and searched on the web.

## Consent & Privacy

In putting this project together, we should be mindful of making sure
that any user that joins a Discord server using this project is made
aware that their forum questions and answers will be shared publically
on a website.

We will also look to see if there is a way to allow providing anonymised
user names, either at general level or a user specifc lavel.


## Implementation

This project is written in Typescript and makes use of the Discord.js
package.
